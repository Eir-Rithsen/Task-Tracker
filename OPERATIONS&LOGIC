# Task Organizer CLI

A simple command-line application to manage tasks efficiently. This tool allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks while keeping track of their statuses (To-Do, In Progress, Done). The tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence.

## Features
### Add new tasks with descriptions.
### Update task descriptions.
### Delete tasks.
### Mark tasks as "In Progress" or "Done."
### List tasks by their status (all, To-Do, In Progress, Done).
